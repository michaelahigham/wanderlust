                <p>The Jerónimos Monastery, also called Hieronymites Monastery, is along with the Tower of Belém, one of the most visited sites in Lisbon. UNESCO declared it a World Heritage Site in 1983. This landmark is called Mosteiro dos Jerónimos in Portuguese.

                    The religious building was designed by the Portuguese architect Diogo de Boitaca to commemorate the return of Vasco da Gama from India. The construction began on 6 January 1501 and wasn’t completed until the seventeenth century.  The building is predominantly Manueline style (Portuguese late Gothic).</p>

                <h2 class="alt-site-title"> EXPERIENCE A FAIRYTALE IN SINTRA</h2> 
                <p class="alt-text">Transport yourself to a picturesque, fairy-tale town with cobbled streets and cheerful painted buildings. Sintra boasts magnificent palaces, ancient castles and stunning landscapes. Sinrta is the perfect destination for a day-trip; connected by regular train, Sintra is only 40 minutes from Lisbon.

                    Explore Sintra by yourself or join an organised tour - both are great options. If you explore yourself, be aware that you have to pay for each castle you enter, so pick which ones take your fancy. We recommend Palácio da Pena Sintra (pictured left) and the The Castelo dos Mouros.</p>

                <p class="alt-text">Since 1983, the tower has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site, along with the Jerónimos Monastery. It is often portrayed as a symbol of Europe's Age of Discoveries and as a metonym for Portugal or Lisbon, given its landmark status.

                <p>The idea of dedicating a museum in Lisbon to their foreign policy endeavours in Asia was created in 1988. Its impressive collections of Portuguese and Asian art demonstrate the historical encounters between the West and the East.
